On this project we found and analyzed a data set regarding healthcare and well-being.
Our main topic is: How does a person achieve excellent work-life balance?

For this project, a dataset (retrieved from Kaggle) of survey responses taken on Authentic-Happiness.com was reviewed to see if any information could be provided that can help answer this question.

The dataset was cleaned by removing survey responses prior to March 2019, leaving responses from March 2019 - March 2021.

Each group member selected a subject from the survey question to focus on and analyze to determine if there is a relationship between the behavior/lifestyle and an excellent work-life balance score.

The survey subjects analyzed were: Daily stress levels, supporting others, weekly meditation, time for passion, and completing weekly to-do list.

The team created a GitHub reposository for this project and was able to create individual branches to work on our own analysis.
We merged branches in with Git, we were able to open review, and merge PRs with GitHub.

We created a powerpoint file to present our analysis to the class, and provide an overall conclusion of this project.
