We found and analyzed a data set regarding healthcare and well-being.
Our main topic is: How does a person achieve excellent work-life balance?

For this project, a dataset (retrieved from Kaggle) of survey responses taken on Authentic-Happiness.com was reviewed to see if any information could be provided that can help answer this question.

The dataset was cleaned by removing survey responses prior to March 2019, leaving a scope of responses from March 2019 - March 2021.

Each group member selected a subject from the survey question to focus on and analyze to determine if there is a relationship between the behavior/lifestyle and an excellent work-life balance score.

The survey subjects analyzed were: Daily stress levels, supporting others, weekly meditation, time for passion, and completing a weekly to-do list.

The team created a GitHub repository for this project and was able to create individual branches to work on our own analysis.
We merged branches in with Git; we were able to open, review, and merge PRs with GitHub.

We created a powerpoint file to present our analysis to the class, and provide an overall conclusion of this project.
