# First-Project

#### How does a person achieve excellent work-life balance?

For this project, a dataset (retrieved from Kaggle) of survey responses taken on Authentic-Happiness.com was reviewed to see if any information could be provided that can help answer this question.

The dataset was cleaned by removing survey 
responses prior to March 2019, leaving 
responses from March 2019 - March 2021.

Each group member selected a subject from the survey question to focus on and analyze to determine if there is a relationship between the behavior/lifestyle and an excellent work-life balance score. 

The survey subjects analyzed were: Daily stress levels, supporting others, weekly meditation, time for passion, and body mass index.
