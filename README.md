TCC Data Analytics - Project 1
Group 4 - Britt Waggoner, Nou Yang, Trevor Bridges, Zechariah Lau.

Our Project 1 track is based on individual wellbeing related to work-life balance.

We created a GitHub repository to use for the project, and indicated the collaborators for this group.
Each collaborator created branches to create our own data analysis and plots.
We utilized Git Worklflows to push, pull, and commit to update our GitHub repository.

The group chose a Dataset from Kaggle and our main topic of interest was around Work-Life Balance,
based on a survey that originally contains 15,000 responses from July 2015 to March 2021.

Each team member chose a survey question to base our individual analysis:
- Trevor's - How do daily stress levels affect work-life balance?
- Nou's - Does supporting other people have an impact on achieving excellent work-life balance?
- Veronica's - Are those who neditate weekly more likely to have a better workl-life balance?
- Britt's - If you spend time doing things you're passionate about daily, how does this change your work-life balance?
- Zac's - 

Data Cleaning - The team decided to scope the analysis from March 2019 to March 2021. Nou was in charge of cleaning the data, and create the sample database.

Each of the team members coded their analysis on a different GitHub repo branch, including:
- Data Exploration utilizing Jupyter notebook.
- Illustrating the final utilizing Jupyter notebook.
- Using Matplotlib to create 10 visualizations (two per question.)
- Saving PNG images of each visualization to distribute to the class and instructional team.
- Creation of a PPT file summarizing our major findings.
